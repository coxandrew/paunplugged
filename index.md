## Sewickley Unplugged Commitment

> As a family, we commit to waiting until at least 9th grade to give our child(ren) a smart phone and delay access to social media until 11th grade. Prior to high school, we will explore "talk and text" only devices for communication needs.
>
> As parents, we will model positive technology behaviors in and outside of the home.
>
> We support school policies that prohibit personal electronic devices throughout the school day.
>
> As stakeholders in our community, we support free-roam childhoods and screen-free experiences. Businesses will offer access to phones and camps, clubs, and activities are encouraged to keep devices away.
